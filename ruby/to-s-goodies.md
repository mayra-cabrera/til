# To_s goodies

The most commonly used `to_` method is probably `to_s`. Every Ruby object, except
instances of BasicObject, responds to `to_s`, and thus has a way of displaying itself as
a string.

```ruby
> "Supercalifragilistico!".to_s
=> "Supercalifragilistico!"
> 1.to_s
=> "1"
```

If you use `to_s` within an object, you'll received a kind of cryptive & descritive message:

```ruby
> Object.new.to_s
=> "#<Object:0x000001030389b0>" #Â Usual class and memory-location screen dump
```

Ruby displays the same thing when you use `puts` within an object

```ruby
> puts Object.new
=> "#<Object:0x000001030389b0>"
```


What you might not know is that by overriding `to_s` method it will surface up to `puts` definition

```ruby
> obj = Object.new
=> #<Object:0x000001011c9ce0>
> puts obj
#<Object:0x000001011c9ce0>
=> nil
> def obj.to_s
 "Well hello there :D"
end
> puts obj
=> Well hello there :D
```

And the same thing will happen using the string interpolation

```ruby
> "My object says: #{obj}"
=> "Well hello there :D"
```
